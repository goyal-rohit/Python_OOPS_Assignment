    "2. Inheritance: This is the ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. It allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.\n",

    "3. Polymorphism: This is the ability of objects to take on many forms. It allows you to use a single interface to represent multiple types of objects.\n",

    "4. Abstraction: This is the process of representing complex real-world objects using simpler and more abstract models. It involves identifying the essential characteristics of an object and ignoring the non-essential details."
